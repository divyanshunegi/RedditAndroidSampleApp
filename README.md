This is sample Reddit Android Project in which you can get notification in interval of 10 minutes if there are new Hot posts available, in case there are you will get a notification sound and the post will be populated in the listview of android.

you can also checkout the webview of the reddit website directly and also refresh the page with swipe refresh on the layout.

Thanks
